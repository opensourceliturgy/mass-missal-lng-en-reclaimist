<p>I believe in one God the Almighty Father creator of heaven and earth and of everything visible and invisible.</p>
<p>And I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ the only son of God, born of the Father before all ages,</p>
<p>God of God, Light of light, true God of true God,</p>
<p>Of One Being with the Father, by Whom all things where made.</p>
<p>Who came down from heaven for us to save us - and for that purpose He was conceived through the power of Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary and became Man.</p>
<p>He was also  crucified for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered death and was buried;</p>
<p>On the third day He rose again, as it is written in the scriptures,</p>
<p>And ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father,</p>
<p>And He shall return in glory to judge the living and the dead and His kingdom shall be endless.</p>
<p>And I believe in the Holy Spirit, Lord and life-giver, who proceeds from the Father,</p>
<p>Together with the Father and the Son She is worshipped and glorified.</p>
<p>She has spoken through the prophets.</p>
<p>And I believe in One holy Catholic and Apostolic Church, I confess one baptism for the forgiveness of sins, I look forward to the resurrection of the dead and the life in the world  to come.</p>
<p>Amen!</p>
